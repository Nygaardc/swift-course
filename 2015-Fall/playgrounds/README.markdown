## Playgrounds
Playgrounds (Xcode > File > New > Playgound) are interactive environments where you can experiment with Swift, much like in a REPL. 

In this folder we can share playgrounds to demo various programming concepts in Swift 2.0. Playgrounds should be simple and show-case with a trivial example of a given concept. Feel free to submit improvements and your own playgrounds. The readme can be used to link to interesting libraries.
